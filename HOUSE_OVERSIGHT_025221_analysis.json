      "In Europe, denial appears to be an essential ingredient to the process... Last week's package is a bold step towards Federalization and the worst-case outcomes have been avoided, but markets will remain nervous about Europe.",
      "The theoretical economic cost could be 3.3% of German GDP every year, which as shown, gets close to some expensive episodes in German history. If German citizens were faced with costs this high, it could be a White Castle hamburger-throwing moment of national proportions."
