    "summary": "This comprehensive report by Freedom House analyzes the methods and strategies employed by modern authoritarian regimes (particularly Russia, China, Hungary, Turkey, Venezuela, and Azerbaijan) to undermine democracy globally. It details how these regimes use sophisticated techniques including propaganda, political interference, economic pressure, legal manipulation, and coercion to maintain power and influence both domestically and internationally. The report highlights concerning trends such as the return of political prisoners, revival of forced confessions, erosion of media freedom, and increased foreign aggression. It also examines how authoritarian governments cultivate relationships with sympathetic political movements in democracies and hire Western lobbyists to burnish their images. The document concludes with recommendations for various sectors to counter these authoritarian threats.",
